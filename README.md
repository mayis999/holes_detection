## Description

Holes Detection is a Python-based project that utilizes the OpenCV library to detect holes in road surfaces. This application processes images or video frames to identify and highlight areas that may contain holes, making it useful for road maintenance and safety applications.

## Features

- **Image Processing**: Detect holes in static images.
- **Video Processing**: Detect holes in video frames in real-time.
- **OpenCV Integration**: Leverages the OpenCV library for efficient image and video processing.

## Technologies

- **Python**: Programming language.
- **OpenCV**: Library for computer vision tasks.
